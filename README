This script is an attempt at merging syntax and marker based folding.  

Folding based on markers is available for all filetypes.  Currently both the {{{ / }}} and the {{{# / }}}# (where # designates the fold level) marking types are supported.

Syntax folding is currently only available for C, Perl, Python, Shell, and Vim filetypes.

Includes function to check and update the foldmarker and line break formats just before saving the file.

As of version 1.3, includes functions to insert (zf) and remove (zd) fold markers that behave similarly to those in the marker fold method.
